**Note:** If you would like to run this analysis on your computer, you
will first need to download the fine-mapping outputs. They can be
downloaded from [here][box-download-link]. Once you have downloaded
the files, copy each file to the "data" or "outputs" subdirectory.

```{r knitr-opts, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = "#",collapse = TRUE,results = "hold",
                      fig.align = "center",dpi = 120)
```

Load some packages and custom functions used in the code below:

```{r load-pkgs, message=FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
source("../code/merge_cs_sets.R")
```
