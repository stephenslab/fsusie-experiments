```

## 
 Here we have a look  at the 1 SNP CS reported by fSuSiE in the fungen xqtl 
 study

```{r load_data}
 out <- readRDS("../data/analysis_result/1_SNP_CS.rds")
```


First we can have a look at the  

minimum Hamming distance between the 1-SNP-CS and the closest SNP in the vincinity


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
