## Data Resources

This folder contains data used directly for generating the figures and illustrations in the manuscript, including resources such as gene references and functional annotations. 
This represents the underlying datasets supporting the manuscript visualizations.

Additionally, we release the following resources from analysis on ROSMAP datasets:

1. [Fine-mapping fitted models](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1lAQykr2ADJk0bDh17zuaM3AhHEerAKqO) for DNA methylation and H3K9ac, including fSuSiE and SuSiE on top 10 PCs, for AD GWAS colocalizaed regions
2. [Complete list of variant level annotations](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1aEsqD6k-4GjUuFuCr-46qz8pdOcbwm1C) generated from fSuSiE including variants within 95% CS (non-zero estimated effects, sentinel variant MAF>0.05)
